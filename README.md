Air quality monitoring is of utmost importance for safeguarding both the environment and human health. 

We presents a novel approach to obtaining the Air Quality Index (AQI) using sky images through the Multi-scale Dilated Network (MDNet), which leads to a reduction of 86.7\% of parameters and 88.5\% of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to Double Output Vision Transformer (DOViT) and achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 94.2\% on Get AQI in One Shot-2 (GAOs-2). The code is coming soon.

With the proposed model enhancements, the authors envision a future where mobile phones can function as individual air quality monitoring stations with model-based software, thereby creating a dynamic and distributed AQI map for air quality protection.
