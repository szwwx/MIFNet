Air quality monitoring is of utmost importance for safeguarding both the environment and human health. 

We introduce a self-supervised learning approach for air quality classification and propose a Masked Image Pre-training Network based on Frequency Domain Representation (MIFNet). We first collect a large number of unlabeled environmental images as training data, significantly enlarging the dataset while eliminating the need for manual annotation, thus reducing labor costs. The code is coming soon.

With the proposed model enhancements, the authors envision a future where mobile phones can function as individual air quality monitoring stations with model-based software, thereby creating a dynamic and distributed AQI map for air quality protection.
